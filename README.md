# monolog—Beyond (We)Blog: Log of Everything

monolog can be expressed in various ways: It is a Wiki-like knowledge management system, and at the same time is a blogging tool.
Blogs, originally coined as "Weblog", started as "log" of "Web" i.e. collections of personal writings that track what websites one has found, and how one thought on them.
monolog extends this concept further from Web to _everything_, therefore is named such; _mono_ means things in Japanese.
